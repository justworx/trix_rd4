 --------- NEW DEVELOPMENT - UNDER CONSTRUCTION! ---------

		The irc/irc_client.py module is deprecated. Use irc.bot.Bot
		instead.


As before...

  This `trix.net.irc` package is under construction.
  It's still buggy, but closer than before.
  There's a long way to go yet.



# Example

```python3

from trix.net.irc.bot import *
b = Bot('Your_Bot_Name')
b.start()

```
